# 🔓 Authentication Temporarily Disabled

The app is now running **without authentication or database** to get it deployed quickly on Netlify.

## ✅ What Works Now

All core functionality works using **localStorage** (browser storage):

- ✅ **Generate Teams** - Create balanced teams from player names
- ✅ **Manage Teams** - Add, edit, delete teams
- ✅ **Enter Matches** - Record game scores
- ✅ **View Standings** - See league table with points
- ✅ **Match History** - Review all past games
- ✅ **Team of the Week** - Track winning teams

Everyone has **full admin access** - no login required!

## 🚀 Deployed App

Your app should now be live at:
**https://myfootballapp.netlify.app**

Just visit and start using it immediately!

---

## 🔧 What Was Disabled

To get the app working on Netlify, we temporarily disabled:

### Removed Files (renamed to `.disabled`):

- `app/login/` → Login page
- `app/register/` → Registration page
- `app/api/auth/` → Authentication API routes

### Code Changes:

- Removed `NextAuth` session checks
- Removed login/logout buttons
- Set `isAdmin = true` for everyone
- Removed `SessionProvider` from layout

---

## 📦 Data Storage

All data is stored in **browser localStorage**:

- Teams
- Match results
- Standings
- Team of the week

**Note**: Data is per-browser. Clearing browser data will reset everything.

## 🔄 How to Re-Enable Auth Later

When you're ready to add authentication back:

### 1. Rename Files Back

```bash
mv app/login.disabled app/login
mv app/register.disabled app/register
mv app/api/auth.disabled app/api/auth
```

### 2. Restore Code

In `app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change this:
const isAdmin = true;

// Back to this:
import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";
const { data: session } = useSession();
const isAdmin = session?.user?.role === "admin";
```

In `app/layout.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add back:
import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";

// Wrap with:
<SessionProvider>
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
</SessionProvider>;
```

### 3. Set Up Turso

Follow **TURSO_SETUP.md** to configure the cloud database.

### 4. Deploy

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Re-enable authentication"
git push
```
