# ðŸ”§ Netlify Build Fix

## Problem

Netlify build is failing with "Module not found" errors, but the build works fine locally.

## Solution

### Option 1: Clear Netlify Build Cache (Easiest)

1. Go to **Netlify Dashboard**
2. Go to **Deploys** tab
3. Click **Trigger deploy** dropdown
4. Select **Clear cache and deploy site**

This forces Netlify to do a fresh build without any cached files.

---

### Option 2: Force a Fresh Deployment

Make a trivial change and push:

```bash
# Make a small change to force redeploy
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force fresh Netlify build"
git push
```

---

### Option 3: Check Node Version

Make sure Netlify is using Node 20:

1. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Environment variables**
2. Check if `NODE_VERSION` is set to `20`
3. If not, add: `NODE_VERSION = 20`

---

### Option 4: Remove Redirect Rule

The redirect rule in `netlify.toml` might be causing issues. Try removing it temporarily:

Edit `netlify.toml` and comment out the redirects section:

```toml
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/*"
#   to = "/index.html"
#   status = 200
```

Then commit and push:

```bash
git add netlify.toml
git commit -m "Remove redirect rule temporarily"
git push
```

---

## Why This Happens

Netlify sometimes caches build artifacts incorrectly, especially when:
- Path aliases (`@/`) are used
- Files were recently restructured
- Environment variables changed

Clearing the cache forces Netlify to rebuild everything from scratch.

---

## Verify Success

After deploying, check:

1. **Build logs** show: âœ… "Compiled successfully"
2. **Health endpoint** works: `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/health`
3. **Main page** loads: `https://your-site.netlify.app`

---

## Still Failing?

If clearing cache doesn't work:

1. **Check the build log** for different errors
2. **Verify all files are committed**: `git status`
3. **Try building locally** with production mode: `NODE_ENV=production yarn build`
4. Share the **new error message** from Netlify build logs
