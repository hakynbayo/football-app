# ðŸ”„ Clear Netlify Cache - IMPORTANT!

## The Problem

Netlify is using **cached build files** from previous attempts, which is why you're still seeing the "Module not found" error even though:

- âœ… The files exist
- âœ… The build works locally
- âœ… The code is committed and pushed

## The Solution: Clear Build Cache

### Follow These Steps **EXACTLY**:

#### 1. Go to Netlify Dashboard

Visit: https://app.netlify.com

#### 2. Select Your Site

Click on your football app site

#### 3. Go to Deploys Tab

Click the **"Deploys"** tab at the top

#### 4. Clear Cache and Redeploy

1. Click the **"Trigger deploy"** dropdown button (top right)
2. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
3. Wait for the build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

## What This Does

- **Deletes** all cached dependencies
- **Deletes** all cached build artifacts
- **Forces** a completely fresh build from scratch
- **Re-installs** all node_modules
- **Re-builds** everything

---

## After Clearing Cache

The build should now succeed! Check:

1. **Build log** shows:

   ```
   âœ“ Compiled successfully
   ```

2. **Visit health endpoint**:

   ```
   https://myfootballapp.netlify.app/api/health
   ```

   Should return:

   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "database": "connected",
     "auth": "configured",
     "turso": "configured"
   }
   ```

3. **Visit your site**:

   ```
   https://myfootballapp.netlify.app
   ```

4. **Login**:
   - Email: `admin@football.app`
   - Password: `Admin@2525`

## If It STILL Fails After Clearing Cache

Try these additional steps:

### Option 1: Check Node Version

1. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Environment variables**
2. Look for `NODE_VERSION`
3. Make sure it's set to `20`
4. If not set or different, add/update: `NODE_VERSION = 20`
5. Redeploy

### Option 2: Verify All Environment Variables

Make sure you have **ALL 6** variables set:

```bash
âœ“ TURSO_DATABASE_URL
âœ“ TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
âœ“ AUTH_SECRET
âœ“ NEXTAUTH_SECRET
âœ“ NEXTAUTH_URL
âœ“ NODE_ENV (should be "production")
```

### Option 3: Check Build Command

1. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Build & deploy** â†’ **Build settings**
2. Verify **Build command** is: `yarn run build`
3. Verify **Publish directory** is: `.next`

## Why Cache Causes This Issue

When you:

1. Made changes to the database setup
2. Added new files (lib/auth.ts, lib/db/index.ts)
3. Modified imports and paths

Netlify cached the **old file structure** and kept trying to use it, even though your new code was pushed. Clearing the cache forces Netlify to "forget" the old structure and use your new code.

---

## âœ… Summary

**Just do this:**

1. **Netlify Dashboard** â†’ **Your Site**
2. **Deploys** tab
3. **Trigger deploy** â†’ **Clear cache and deploy site**
4. **Wait** for build to complete
5. **Test** your site

**This should fix it!** ðŸŽ‰
